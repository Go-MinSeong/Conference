#### Why I do this Project?
When I read a book, Somethimes I imagine the place that main character live in or apperance of characters in books.

There are many books that just only have text. So if there are any images, I think that it was so nice. 

Imagine that we can see the characters in the novel we read.

<h3 align="left"> Method </h3>

#### 1. Summarize each chapter of the novel.
    -  if we didn't summarize the text, we can't any propoer image. Because too many text make image generator confuse.


#### 2. Generate Scence


#### 3. Retouch Image
